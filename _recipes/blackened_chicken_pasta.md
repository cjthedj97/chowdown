- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1 cup sliced button mushrooms

- 1/4 cup sliced green onions
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan
- Creole seasoning, to taste

directions:

- Place olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and add chicken; cook until cooked through, turning chicken halfway through.
- Remove from pan and slice into bite-sized pieces. 
- Return chicken pieces to pan with mushrooms, tomatoes, green onions and minced garlic.
- Saute together while tossing occasionally for 2 minutes. 
- Add heavy cream, Parmesan, Creole seasoning and noodles to chicken and vegetables and cook, stirring frequently to heat noodles and melt cheese.
