servings: 4
prep_time: "10 mins"
cook_time: "20-25 mins"
total_time: "30-35 mins"

ingredients:
- 1 tbsp olive oil or 1 tbsp butter
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 700–800 g (about 4 cups) pumpkin, peeled, seeded and cut into chunks
- 1 medium potato, peeled and diced (optional — adds body)
- 600–800 ml (2½–3½ cups) vegetable or chicken stock, enough to just cover the veg
- 120 ml (½ cup) cream, milk or coconut milk (optional)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Pinch ground nutmeg (optional)
- 1 tsp brown sugar or maple syrup (optional, to balance acidity)
- To serve: olive oil or extra cream, roasted pumpkin seeds, chopped chives

directions:
- Heat the oil or butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 5–7 minutes until soft and translucent.
- Add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.
- Add the pumpkin (and potato if using) and toss to coat in the oil; sauté for 2–3 minutes.
- Pour in enough stock to just cover the vegetables. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered until the pumpkin (and potato) are very tender, about 15–20 minutes.
- Remove from heat and purée the soup until smooth using an immersion blender. (Alternatively, blend in batches in a stand blender — be careful with hot liquids.)
- Return to low heat. Stir in the cream or coconut milk if using. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a little brown sugar or maple syrup if desired. Warm gently — do not boil if using dairy.
- Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve hot, drizzled with a little olive oil or cream and sprinkled with roasted pumpkin seeds and chopped chives.
