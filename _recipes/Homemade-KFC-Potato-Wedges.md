ingredients:
- 3 lbs Russet potatoes
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1  cup milk
- 1 egg
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- teaspoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning optional
- oil for frying

directions:
- Wash potatoes well, and cut into small wedges. The wedges should be no larger than 3/8 of an inch thick at the outside of the potato. Ideally, the potato wedges should be cut as uniformly as possible.
- Place the potato wedges in a large bowl and add enough water to cover the potatoes. Allow the potatoes to soak for at least 1 hour (best overnight).
- Combine milk and egg in a small bowl. Whisk together to mix the egg fully into the milk.
- In another bowl, combine flour, salt, garlic salt, onion powder, black pepper, and poultry seasoning.
- Heat oil to 350 degrees.
- Dredge the potatoes in the flour, then dip into the egg wash, and then back into the flour.
- Place the breaded potatoes on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet to allow them to dry. The coating will set up and stay on the potatoes better if allowed to set for 5 to 10 minutes before frying
- Fry potatoes in batches for 5 to 6 minutes, remove and place on a wire rack to drain.
- After the first cooking time, place each batch of potatoes back into the oil for another 3 to 4 minutes. This second cooking will result in potatoes with a very crisp outer coating. When removed for the second time drain on the wire rack, and then serve immediately.
