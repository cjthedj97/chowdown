preptime: PT30m
cooktime: PT10m
yield: 4 Servings

ingredients:
- ⅓ cup cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour divided use
- 2 tablespoons paprika divided use
- 2 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper divided use
- 12 ozs beer
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 4 Vidalia onions or other large sweet onions
- Bloomin’ Onion Sauce or Creamy Chili Sauce to serve

directions:
- To make the batter, combine the cornstarch, minced garlic, and salt with 1 ½ cups of flour, 2 teaspoons of paprika, and 2 teaspoons of ground black pepper. Mix well. Add the beer and mix to combine.
- To make the seasoned flour, combine the garlic powder and cayenne pepper with 2 cups of flour, 4 teaspoons of paprika, and ½ teaspoon of ground black pepper. Mix well.
- Cut about ¾ inch off the top of the onions and peel them. Cut each onion into 12 to 16 vertical wedges, but do not cut through the bottom root end. Remove about 1 inch of petals from the center of the onion. You may want to separate the onion petals slightly, but do not do this too much or you will destroy the onion.
- Dip the onions into the seasoned flour and shake off the excess. Dip the onions into the batter, separating the petals to ensure they are thoroughly coated. Then dip the onions into the seasoned flour again.
- Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 375°F to 400°F. Gently place the onions into the fryer basket and deep-fry for 1 ½ minutes on each side. Remove the onions from the fryer and drain on paper towels.
- To serve, place the onion upright in a shallow bowl and remove the center core with a circular cutter or apple corer. Serve hot with Bloomin’ Onion Sauce or Creamy Chili Sauce.
