tags: potato eggs cheese chives breakfast

ingredients:
- 1 baked potato
- 1 large egg
- cheese (grated)
- salt (to taste)
- pepper (to taste)
- chives

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350.
- Cut top third of potato off (hot dog style, like long ways).
- Using a small spoon scoop out the insides of the potato. Leave as much or as little as you want on the sides.
- Sprinkle a little salt, pepper, cheese and chives in the bottom of your potato.
- Crack an egg into your hollowed potato.
- Sprinkle with additional salt, pepper, cheese and chives on top.
- Place on a baking sheet and bake for 20-30 minutes depending how runny you want your egg. (I baked ours for 28 minutes because I didn't want any gooey white and the yellow was almost completely solid.)
