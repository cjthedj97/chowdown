ingredients:
- 1 ⅓ lb ground beef See Note 1
- ⅓ medium onion finely diced
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 egg
- ⅓ cup panko bread crumbs See Note 2
- 2 ½ Tablespoons milk
- 2 teaspoons ketchup
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- ¾ teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon pepper
- 2 cloves garlic (optional) minced
- ¼ cup red wine to steam patty
- ⅓ cup ketchup
- 3 Tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 3 Tablespoons water or stock
- 2 Tablespoons butter
- 2 teaspoons sugar

directions:

- Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add the vegetable oil and diced onions. Saute until softened. Remove and set aside.
- In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, sauteed onions, egg, panko bread crumbs, milk, ketchup, Worcestershire, sea salt, pepper, and garlic. Mix well until it becomes a smooth texture.
- Divide the patties into four sections and form into tight oval patties. Lightly oil hands for easier shaping. See Note 3.
- Lightly oil a large pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add the hamburger steak and cook each side for 3 to 4 minutes. Then add the red wine and cover to steam until the steak patties are fully cooked (internal temperature of 160° F). Remove and set aside.
- Using the same pan, reduce heat to low and add the ingredients for the sauce. Stir until it starts to bubble. Turn off the heat and serve with hamburger steaks. See Note 4.

Ground meat: You can opt to use a combination of ground beef and pork. Keep the ground beef to at least 60% for the best flavor. Otherwise, if you prefer a beefier flavor, use 100% ground beef. I used 85% lean. 

Panko bread crumbs: Substitute with regular unseasoned bread crumbs. If you opt to use seasoned bread crumbs, leave out salt as it may be too salty.

Forming hambagu steaks: Remove air pockets from the patty by tossing them back and forth between your hands. This helps keep its shape during cooking.

Sauce: If preferred, wipe off excess grease from the pan first. For a thinner sauce, increase the amount of water a Tablespoon at a time and add more salt and sugar to your liking.
