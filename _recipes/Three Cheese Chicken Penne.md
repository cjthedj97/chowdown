ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1/3 cup Italian salad dressing
- 4 ripe tomatoes, finely chopped
- 2-3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 6 tablespoons olive oil, divided

directions:
- Slice the chicken breasts into bite-sized cubes and marinate them in Italian salad dressing for 30 minutes.
- In a separate bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes, minced garlic, dried basil, and 4 tablespoons of olive oil to create the bruschetta topping.
- Cook the penne pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
- Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until fully cooked, about 5-7 minutes.

- Serve by layering Alfredo-coated penne, cooked chicken, bruschetta topping, and shredded Italian cheese.

For added flavor, you can grill the chicken instead of pan-frying it. If desired, assemble the dish in a baking dish, top with cheese, and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 15-20 minutes until bubbly.
