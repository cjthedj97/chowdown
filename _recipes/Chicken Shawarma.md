ingredients:
- 1 cup tomato paste
- 1 cup white distilled vinegar
- 1/2 cup minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons Spanish paprika
- 2 tablespoons crushed red pepper
- 1 tablespoon ground coriander
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon sumac
- Salt and pepper
- 10 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs and legs
- Zaytoon Garlic Sauce, recipe follows
- One 10-pound can cooked diced potatoes
- 3 cups heavy-duty mayonnaise
- 1 1/2 cups peeled garlic cloves
- 1 tablespoon lemon salt
- Kosher salt

## Instructions
- Combine the tomato paste, vinegar, garlic, paprika, red pepper, coriander, cumin, oregano, sumac, 2 tablespoons salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper and 1 cup water in a large mixing bowl. Whisk until thoroughly mixed.
- Put the chicken in a large bowl and pour the marinade over the chicken; mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
- Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
- Fillet open the chicken thighs, making them as thin as possible. Stack the chicken vertically on a skewer, pushing it down as you go to make it as tight as possible.
- Place the chicken on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes per side. Slice the chicken into thin pieces and serve with Zaytoon Garlic Sauce.
- Add the potatoes, mayonnaise, garlic, lemon salt, 1 tablespoon kosher salt and 1 cup ice to a 20-cup food processor. Process until smooth and creamy.
