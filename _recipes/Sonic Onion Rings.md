ingredients:
- 2 lbs Spanish onions sliced, and rings separated
- 24 ozs water
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 12 ozs vanilla ice cream melted
- 8 ozs cornmeal
- vegetable oil for frying
- 
directions:
- Peel onions. Slice onions into slices that are between 3/8 and Â½-inch. Remove the small center of the onions, you can chop those into diced onions. Separate onions into rings, and place the rings into a large bowl of water.
- Place three containers in a row. In the first container, place the flour, in the second container, place the melted ice cream, and in the third container place the cornmeal.
- Preheat oil to 350 degrees.
- Prepare onion rings by shaking off the water, dip onion into the flour, shake off excess flour. Dip into the melted ice cream, and then dip into the cornmeal. Gently shake off excess cornmeal. Place the onion ring on a cookie sheet to dry for a few minutes before frying.
- Fry onion rings until golden brown.

Sifting the flour and cornmeal once in a while keeps lumps out and makes it easier to coat the rings When placing on cookie sheets to save room, lean on top of each other to allow the entire ring to dry.
