yield: 6 Servings
preptime: PT1h50m
cooktime: PT20m


ingredients:
- ½ cup warm water ~100° to 110°F
- 2 ½ teaspoons instant yeast 1 package
- 1 ¼ cups water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cups (22 ozs) bread flour plus more for working the dough
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 3 tablespoons butter melted
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

directions:
- Place ½ cup of warm water and yeast in a medium bowl and whisk together briefly. Allow the yeast enough time to bubble up and become active. This should take a few minutes. If the yeast is inactive, you may need to replace the yeast and try again.
- Add room temperature water and oil to the yeast mixture, and stir to combine.
- Place the flour and salt in a food processor, and pulse to combine.
- Add the yeast mixture through the tube of the food processor and process. The dough will form into a ball. Process until the dough is smooth and elastic.
- Place the dough in a bowl that has been sprayed with non-stick spray, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until doubled in size, up to 2 hours.
- Preheat the oven to 375°F.
- Gently pat out the dough on a floured surface into a rectangular shape.
- Cut the dough into two equal portions down the middle. Then make about 8 cuts horizontally across the dough.
- Roll each portion of dough into a breadstick.
- Spray a baking sheet with non-stick spray and place the dough strips onto the baking sheet.
- Bake for about 18 minutes or until the breadsticks become golden.
- Mix the melted butter and the garlic salt.
- Brush the garlic sauce over the breadsticks and sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.
