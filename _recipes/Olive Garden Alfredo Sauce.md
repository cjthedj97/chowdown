For a thicker sauce, consider adding 2 tablespoons of cream cheese. For a touch of spice, include ground white pepper. Although not used in the original Olive Garden sauce, a pinch of nutmeg can be added for extra flavor. Store any leftover sauce separately from the pasta and reheat gently over low heat, adding a splash of cream if needed to adjust the consistency.
