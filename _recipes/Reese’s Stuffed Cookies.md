tag: Dessert
preptime: PT20m
cooktime: PT14m

ingredients:
- 1 cup unsalted butter softened (226g)
- ⅓ cup creamy peanut butter (90g) I have NOT tried this with natural peanut butter
- ¾ cup sugar (150g)
- cup brown sugar tightly packed (150g)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour (380g)
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch (cornflour in the UK)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups chocolate chips I use half regular chocolate chips and half mini (semisweet), but you can do any combination. (340g)
- 16 Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups standard size

directions:
- Place your Reese’s Cups in the freezer so that they will harden and be easy to stuff in the cookie dough.
- In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in large bowl using electrical mixer), cream together butter, peanut butter, and sugars until light and fluffy.  Scrape sides of bowl.
- Add eggs and vanilla extract. Beat until well-combined (again, pause to scrape down the sides of bowl, as needed).
- In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
- Gradually add flour mixture to batter while stirring on low speed until completely combined.
- Stir in chocolate chips.
- Place dough in refrigerator to chill 15-30 minutes (if dough is too sticky at 15 minutes, allow it to chill longer, it should be soft and pliable, but not messy).
- Remove chilled dough from fridge and Reese’s cups from freezer.  Remove peanut butter cups from their wrappers.
- Scoop dough by heaping 1 ½ Tbs-sized spoonful and press peanut butter cup sideways into the center.  Scoop more dough, as needed, and form around peanut butter cup until it is completely concealed.
- Roll into round ball and place on a wax-paper lined plate or tray. Return cookie dough balls to refrigerator for 15 minutes.
- Preheat oven to 375F (190C) and line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
- Place cookie dough balls at least 2″ apart on cookie sheet and bake on 375 (190C) for 14 minutes, or until edges are just beginning to turn golden brown.
- Allow cookies to cool completely on cookie sheet (they will be very fragile when hot) before serving.  Enjoy!
