- ½ cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 cans (16.3 oz) refrigerated Pillsbury™ Grands!™ Southern Homestyle Buttermilk Biscuits (8 Count)
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ¾ cup butter or margarine, melted


directions:
- Heat oven to 325°F. Lightly grease 12-cup fluted tube cake pan.
- In large plastic food-storage bag, mix granulated sugar and cinnamon. Separate dough into a total of 16 biscuits; cut each into quarters. Shake in bag to coat. Arrange in pan. Mix brown sugar and butter; pour over biscuit pieces.

For the best results, keep the biscuit dough in the refrigerator until just before you use it. Warm dough might get sticky and be hard to handle.
