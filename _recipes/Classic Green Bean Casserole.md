For a festive touch, consider adding 1/4 cup of chopped red pepper with the green beans. For a crunchy variation, try adding 1/4 cup of toasted sliced almonds to the onion topping. If using Unsalted Cream of Mushroom Soup, you may add salt to taste, about 1/4 teaspoon. This dish can be stored in an oven-safe dish for easy reheating.
