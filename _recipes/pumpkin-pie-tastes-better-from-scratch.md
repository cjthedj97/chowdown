ingredients:
- 1 (9-inch) unbaked pie crust (homemade or store-bought)
- 3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- Pinch ground nutmeg (optional)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 (15 oz / 425 g) can pumpkin puree or about 2 cups homemade pumpkin puree
- 1 (12 fl oz / 354 ml) can evaporated milk (or substitute half-and-half for a richer filling)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Optional: 1/4 cup brown sugar for deeper flavor
- To serve: whipped cream

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
- In a large bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg (if using).
- Beat the eggs in a separate bowl. Add pumpkin puree and the sugar-spice mixture; mix until combined.
- Gradually stir in the evaporated milk and vanilla until the filling is smooth. If using brown sugar, add it here.
- Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust and smooth the top.
- Bake at 425°F (220°C) for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and bake another 35–45 minutes, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean and the filling is set.
- Remove pie from the oven and cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours. Chill before serving to finish setting (recommended).
