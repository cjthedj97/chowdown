preptime: PT7m
cooktime: PT13m

ingredients:
- Dry ingredients:
	- 1 ⅓ cups bread flour (or plain/all-purpose flour, Note 2)
	- 2 tsp baking powder
	- ¾ tsp salt
	- ¾ tsp sugar
- Wet ingredients:
	- 2 tsp olive oil (or any other oil)
	- ½ cup water (cold tap water)
- Other
	- 1 tbsp Extra Flour, for dusting
	- 2 tsp vegetable oil (optional), for brushing crust (or canola or other neutral oil) (Note 3)

directions:
	- Preheat oven to 250°C / 480°F (230°C fan) (Note 4.) Place the shelf in the top quarter of the oven.
	- Spray pizza pan or baking tray lightly with oil.
	- Prepare pizza sauce and toppings. Keep shredded mozzarella in the fridge (Note 5).
- Food processor (40 sec):
	- Using the standard S blade, add Dry Ingredients and pulse twice. Add water and olive oil. Blitz on low for 40 seconds - it will come together into a shaggy ball (video 33 sec).
	- Sprinkle the work surface with half the Extra Flour, and scrape the dough out. Sprinkle with remaining Extra Flour and firmly shape into a ball.
- Hand Kneading (3 min):
	- Place Dry ingredients in a bowl, and mix to combine with a rubber spatula. Add water and olive oil, and mix until flour is incorporated as best you can.
	- Sprinkle the work surface with half the Extra Flour, and dump the dough out. Sprinkle with remaining Extra Flour then knead for 3 to 4 minutes until it's pretty smooth, using more flour only if needed.
- Rolling out dough:
	- Dough should be soft and elastic, and not stick to your hands. It will not be completely smooth like yeast dough (Note 6).
	- Shape dough into a ball. Roll out into a 30cm/12" round.
	- Transfer to a pizza pan, preferably with holes (for a crispier base), or a baking tray (Note 7 pizza stone). Use your fingers to pull from the center to fill the pan to the edge - avoid pinching the edges (to ensure a puffy crust!).
- Top & bake:
	- Top with ¼ cup pizza sauce and toppings of choice.
	- Brush the crust edge (just the exposed edge with no toppings on it) with oil.
	- Bake 12 minutes, until the edges are crispy and golden. Cut and serve immediately!

1. Scaling up - unlike yeast dough, this dough can't be left out to rest or rise (it depletes all the rising power so won't rise as well in the oven). Once Wet is mixed with Dry ingredients, it needs to be used within about 30 minutes.
We found the best way to make multiple pizzas is as follows: Scale the recipe up to a maximum of 3 pizzas at a time. While the 1st pizza is in the oven, roll out the base of pizzas #2 and #3 (rather than leaving balls sitting around) - it's ok for rolled-out crusts can rise a bit while waiting. Transfer rolled-out crusts to baking paper (parchment paper) and keep covered with a lightly damp tea towel. Top just before baking (never leave raw dough with sauce and toppings lying around, makes dough soggy).
2. Flour - bread flour has higher protein so will make the crust more chewy and give it a crumb structure more akin to yeast pizza dough. Sometimes sold as "pizza flour".
If you don't have it, don't make a special trip out to get some - just use plain/all-purpose flour. It is still an exceptional crust!
Gluten-free flour - not yet tested, but will do so soon!
3. Oil for the crust - helps give the crust a bit of color and make it a bit crispier like real yeast pizza. Most no yeast pizza crusts are pale white which lacks flavour and colour (or are way overcooked, making the inside dry). Brushing with oil solves this problem.
4. Oven - or as high as it will go if you can't reach these temps, and cook for a touch longer (as in 1 minute or so!). I made it tons of times at 200°C/390°F but we just found that a higher temp will brown the crust better, making it look more like real Italian pizza.
5. Chilled cheese - no yeast pizza dough needs to be cooked a touch longer than yeast pizza to achieve the same slightly crispy exterior on the crust edges and to get a bit of color. So you get slightly more brown patches on the cheese than ideal. Easy get around - just ensure the shredded cheese is chilled right up until you use it. 
6. Dough - soft and elastic to the touch, it should not be so sticky that it gets stuck all over your hands. If it is, then add flour 1 tbsp at a time and knead it in, until the dough is the right consistency. If it's too dry, add water 1 teaspoon at a time until it's softer.
You need to roll it out with conviction - it is an elastic dough and it will want to shrink back to its original size! Once transferred to the pan, use your fingers to pull the base from the center to fill the pan, being sure to avoid pinching the edges (to get nice puffy crusts).
7. Pizza stone - place in oven to preheat. Sprinkle the entire surface of the wooden paddle with semolina (or flour). Roll out dough per recipe, then place it on a wooden paddle. Top with sauce and toppings. Slide onto a preheated stone, then bake for 10 minutes.
8. Nutrition per slice, assuming 8 slices, base only (because toppings vary so much!)
