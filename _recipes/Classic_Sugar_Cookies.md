ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups powdered sugar
- 1 cup butter or margarine room temperature
- 1 ½ tsp vanilla
- 1 egg room temperature
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp cream of tartar*

directions:
- In a large bowl or your stand mixer, mix butter, sugar, egg and vanilla.
- Stir in the flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar, just until combined.
- Cover and refrigerate for at least thirty minutes.
- For cut-outs: Roll chilled dough onto a lightly floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick. Cut out desired shapes and place 2" apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 7-8 minutes. Allow to cool a couple of minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
- For drop cookies: Using your hands or a cookie scoop, roll dough into two inch balls. Roll in granulated sugar or dip in sprinkles (optional) and place on a cookie sheet about 2-inches apart. Press down lightly with the palm of your hand. Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 7-8 minutes. Allow to cool a couple of minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Frost with your favorite icing recipe.

* If you don't have cream of tartar on hand you can replace the last three ingredients (flour, baking soda, cream of tartar) with self rising flour.
