servings: 1 cup
prep_time: "5 mins"
cook_time: "10 mins"
total_time: "15 mins"

ingredients:
- 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter
- 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
- 1¼ cups whole milk, heated
- Kosher salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

directions:
- Warm the milk on low heat until little bubbles form at the edges; remove from heat.
- Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste cooks and bubbles a bit, about 2 minutes, without letting it brown.
- Slowly add the heated milk, whisking to incorporate. Bring it to a boil, stirring constantly, as the sauce thickens.
- Add kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Reduce to low heat, and cook, stirring, for another 2–3 minutes. Remove from the heat.
- To cool the sauce for later use, cover it with wax paper, or pour a layer of milk over it to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for up to 3 days.
- **Variation:** For a Cheese Sauce, stir in ½ cup grated cheddar cheese during the last 2 minutes of cooking, along with a pinch of cayenne pepper.
