- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground Mexican cinnamon (canela)
- ¼ teaspoon pequen chili powder or cayenne pepper

with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on two sides. Press the
paper into the corners of the pan and lightly grease the paper with
butter.
- Melt the 2 sticks of butter in a nonstick saucepan over medium-low
heat; do not boil. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Add
the sugar, eggs and vanilla to the saucepan and stir with a wooden
spoon until combined.

paper to lift out the brownies before slicing
