imagecredit: https://copykat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/KFC-Cole-Slaw-Final.jpg

ingredients:

- 13 cups chopped cabbage This is about 1 large head of cabbage or 2 medium heads of cabbage
- 1 green bell pepper (optional, there is no bell pepper in the KFC recipe)
- cup choped onion
- cup chopped carrot 1 medium size carrot
- 2 cups Miracle Whip Light
- cup sugar
- ¼ cup vinegar
- ¼ cup vegetable oil

directions:

- If you are lucky enough to have a food processor, get it out of your cupboard. Start to cut up the cabbage and place it in the processor. While cutting up the cabbage, also cut up small slices of green pepper, onion, and carrot and add to the processor.
- Mixing up the ingredients this way will help distribute the flavors throughout the slaw. You may want to use a little less of the onion, or green bell pepper, but do use all of the carrot.
- If you do not have a food processor, no problem, simply chop the cabbage, onions, and carrots into small pieces.  Add chopped green bell pepper if desired.
- Now mix Miracle Whip, vinegar, oil, and sugar until you have a smooth mixture. The taste should be sweet with just a hint of vinegar.
- Amount of dressing may be increased or decreased according to the amount of slaw you are making. Add to cut up veggies and mix well. Let stand at least one hour to let flavors mix.
